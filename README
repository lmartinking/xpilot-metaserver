What is this?
-------------
This is an open source implementation of the XPilot meta server, i.e. the server that all 
public XPilot game servers register with in order to be discovered by clients. This implementation
has been written based on analysis of the server and client source code. See the file PROTOCOL for 
details.

This implementation may be incomplete. Please contact the author(s) if you have questions or bug reports.

Changes wrt the old meta server
-------------------------------
1) Old: servers are registered with the port that they specify themselved in the registration packet.
New: for security reasons servers are registered with the actual port the registration packet is sent from.

2) Old: the number of free teams sent to clients seems to include robot teams.
New: the number of free teams sent to clients includes only the teams that human players can join.
