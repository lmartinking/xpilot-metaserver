2. Format of the message sent by server

Each message is sent with the trailing zero.
Each message consists of one or more commands. Each command is terminated with '\n'.
a) Add server
"add server $Server.host
add version $META_VERSION
add users $num_active_players
add map $Setup->name
add sizeMap ${World.x}x${World.y}
add author $Setup->author
add bases $World.NumBases
add fps $fps
add port $contactPort
add mode $game_mode
add teams $World.NumTeams
add free $freebases
freebases has value if mode is team_play
for each team that is not a robot team and has more than 0 bases:
team record: ${team_number}=${num_bases - num_active_players_in_team}
num_active_players_in_team is set if mode is team_play, for each active human player
team records are separated by comma
add timing 0
add stime $(int32_t) (time(NULL) - serverStartTime)
add queue $NumQueuedPlayers
add sound $SOUND_SUPPORT_STR
add players 
for each player that: is human AND (is alive OR is appearing OR is waiting or is dead):
player record: ${name}=${realname}@${hostname}${team}
${team} only has value if team play: "{${pl->team->Num}}
player records are separated by comma
add status $status_str
\0"

game_mode: if game_lock: "locked", else "ok"

b) Remove server
"server ${serverhost}
remove\0"

In order to hinder unauthorised removal of servers from the database, the meta
server does not use serverhost to determine the server to remove. It uses the
remote ip_addr:port instead.


3. Communication ports

a) server: udp/5500
b) client (meta prog port): tcp/4401
c) user: tcp/4400
